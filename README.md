## Description

This is a website demonstrating my abilities with caching files, utilizing indexedDB, and PWA standards. The site is a budget tracker that tracks deposits and withdrawls using a chart.

## Installation

There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage

This site allows the user to create to add transactions to a table of past transactions and a transaction chart. Each transaction will update the total budget, the chart of transactions, and the table representing the budget/transactions. The site allows the user to continue posting transactions even when the user loses internet connection and then adds all posts done offline to the database once the user regains their connection.
